Description:
    Stubs out a new service. Pass the service name, either
       CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of its methods as arguments.

       To create a service within a module, just add --module NAME, or --module=NAME

       This generates a service class in app/services, or app/services/module if module name is present.

Example:
    `rails generate service MailerService send receive --module MailerModule`

    This will create:
        app/services/mailer_module/mailer_service.rb
